## FlyballETS-Hardware

The FlyballETS-Hardware project is a subproject of the [Flyball ETS project](https://www.sparkydevices.com/tag/flyball-ets/).
It contains the designs for the electronic hardware which is required to build the Flyball-ETS project.

## Design Files

The design files are in Eagle format, and consist of several files:
* FlyballETS-Board.sch/brd: Schematic and board file for the PCB of Flyball ETS
* FlyballETS-Board-BOM.txt: Bill of materials used to know which components to order and where to solder them on the board

These files can be used by people who want to improve or change the design.

## Export Files
`Exports/FlyballETS-Board-BRD/SCH.png` are picture exports of the design files so people can view them without needing to install EAGLE
