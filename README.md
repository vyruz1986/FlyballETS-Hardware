The FlyballETS-Hardware project is a subproject of the [Flyball ETS project](https://sparkydevices.wordpress.com/tag/flyball-ets/).
It contains the designs for the electronic hardware which is required to build the Flyball-ETS project.

## Design Files

The design files are in Eagle format, and consist of 3 sets of files:
* FlyballETS-MBD.sch/brd: Schematic and board file for the 'Mainboard' PCB of Flyball ETS
* FlyballETS-LIGHTS.sch/brd: Schematic and board file for the 'LIGHTS' PCB of Flyball ETS
* FlyballETS-SENSORS.sch/brd: Schematic and board file for the 'SENSORS' PCB of Flyball ETS

These files can be used by people who want to improve or change the design.
